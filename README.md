# assign_app
This project is a Flutter application developed as part of an assignment. The UI is designed based on the Figma design provided by the company.

# Features Implemented-
Login and Signup functionality using Firebase.
Home Page UI designed to closely resemble the provided Figma design.
Various screens, including interactive elements and form validation.

# Note on UI Design-
While I made every effort to ensure that the UI closely matches the design, there is a minor detail that I couldn't fully implement:

Vector Image (Line between Green and Red Circles on the Home Page): I was unable to replicate this vector design exactly as shown in the Figma file. Despite this, I have implemented a clean and functional alternative that keeps the user experience seamless.
